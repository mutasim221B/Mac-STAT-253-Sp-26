# Learning Goals {.unnumbered .smaller}

- Identify the appropriate task (regression, classification, unsupervised) for a given research question
- Develop foundation to be able to formulate research questions that align with regression, classification, or unsupervised learning tasks

## What's Machine Learning? {.unnumbered .smaller}

:::: .columns
::: {.column width=50%} 

**"Machine Learning"** was coined back in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an early contributor to AI.

**From Kohavi & Provost (1998):** Machine Learning is the exploration & application of algorithms that can *learn* from existing patterns and make predictions using data. 

> **IMPORTANT:** _humans_ are in charge of the "exploration & application"!

**From James et al (2021) [[link]](https://www.statlearning.com/):** *Statistical Learning* refers to a vast set of tools for *understanding data*.

## In STAT 253 we will... {.unnumbered .smaller}

::: {.incremental}
- Pick up where **STAT 155** left off, acquiring tools that can be used to learn from data in greater depth and a wider variety of settings. (STAT 155 is a foundational subset of ML!)

- Explore *universal* ML concepts using tools and software common among statisticians (hence "statistical" machine learning).

- **Survey** a breadth of modern ML tools and algorithms that fall into the workflow below. Part of the cognitive load will be:  

  - keeping all the tools in place (what are they and when to use them)
  
  - understanding the connections between the tools
  
  - adapting (not memorizing) code to implement each tool
  
  - *a new topic almost every day* 
  
- We'll focus on concepts and applications over mathematical theory. (Come chat with me in office hours if you're interested in learning more about the theory!)

# Notes: Machine Learning Overview {.unnumbered}

## Types of ML Tasks {.unnumbered .smaller}

![](../images/MLdiagram.jpg){width=100%}

Statistical machine learning tools can be classified as follows:

- **supervised** or **unsupervised**
- within supervised learning: **regression** vs **classification**
- within unsupervised learning: **clustering** vs **dimension reduction** 

Knowing which of these scenarios your research question falls into is an important first step in identifying which tool to use!


\

## Supervised Learning {.unnumbered .smaller}       

We want to model the relationship between some *output* variable[^1] $y$ and *input*  variables[^2] $x = (x_1, x_2,..., x_p)$: 

[^1]: otherwise known as *outcome*, *response*, *dependent variable*
[^2]: otherwise known as *predictors*, *features*, *independent variables*

$$
\begin{split}
y 
& = f(x) + \varepsilon \\
& = \text{(trend in the relationship) } + \text{ (residual deviation from the trend)} \\
\end{split}
$$


Types of supervised learning tasks:     

- **regression**: $y$ is *quantitative*       
    example:        
    $y$ = number of dental caries (cavities)  
    $x$ = (genetic information at millions of markers, sex, age, age$^2$, etc)  
    [project details](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10630-1)
    
- **classification**: $y$ is *categorical*        
    example:        
    $y$ = whether a patient experienced adverse surgery outcomes after undergoing an upper endoscopy (yes, no)   
    $x$ = (administration of sedation [anesthesia professional, nurse], age, medical comorbidities [eg sleep apnea], etc.)  
    [project details](https://www.giejournal.org/article/S0016-5107(18)32182-5/fulltext)    


\


## Unsupervised Learning {.unnumbered .smaller}     

We have some *input* variables $x = (x_1, x_2,..., x_p)$ but there's **no *output* variable** $y$. Thus the goal is to use $x$ to understand and/or modify the structure of our data.


Types of unsupervised learning tasks:       


:::: .columns
::: {.column width=60%} 

<!-- update to use examples from instructor's research! -->

- **clustering**: Identify and examine *groups* or *clusters* of data points that are similar with respect to their $x_i$ values.   
    example:   
    $x$ = (genetic data)   
    [project details](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cam4.5266) (led by a Mac alum!)
    
- **dimension reduction**: Turn the original set of $p$ input variables, which are potentially correlated, into a smaller set of $k < p$ variables which still preserve the majority of information in the originals.   
    example:   
    $x$ = (genetic data)     
    [project details](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1011242)

4. **Machine learn about each other! Scenario A.**    
    I collected some data on STAT 253 students (you!) and analyzed it using a machine learning algorithm. In your groups: (1) brainstorm what research question is being investigated; (2) determine whether this is a regression, classification, or clustering task; _and_ (3) summarize what the output tells you about your classmates.
    
```{r exercise4}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| fig-width: 16
#| fig-height: 7

library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
# Classification
# new_dat <- survey %>% 
#       select(-fake_name, -email, -section,-name) %>% 
#       unique()
new_dat <- survey_clean %>% 
      select(-`Preferred Name`, -`Unique Word`, -Section) %>% 
      unique()
    
# increase minsplit to prune tree.  this is essentially the number of students that can be in a terminal node
# or do two trees -- one pruned and one unpruned
set.seed(1)
# tree_0 <- rpart(major ~ ., new_dat, 
#                     control = rpart.control(minsplit = 5, cp = 0.02))
tree_0 <- rpart(Major ~ ., new_dat, 
                    control = rpart.control(minsplit = 5, cp = 0.02))
rpart.plot(tree_0, cex = 1.15, type = 0, extra = 2, box.palette="Blues")
```
    
    
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
1. predict someone's major based on other survey responses
2. classification ($y$ = major is categorical)
3. (will vary by semester -- what do you learn about the majors represented in this class and the variables that are useful for predicting it?)
</details>

5. **Machine learn about each other! Scenario B.**    
    Same directions as for Scenario A:    (1) brainstorm what research question is being investigated; (2) determine whether this is a regression, classification, or clustering task; _and_ (3) summarize what the output tells you about your classmates.
    
```{r exercise5}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| fig-width: 6
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# regression
# g1 <- ggplot(survey, aes(y = time_to_mac, x = cute_pic)) + 
#   geom_point() + 
#   geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
g1 <- ggplot(survey_clean, aes(y = `Walk Time`, x = `Photo Rating`)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
# g2 <- ggplot(survey %>% mutate(year = fct_relevel(year,c('First Year','Sophomore','Junior','Senior'))), aes(y = time_to_mac, x = year)) + 
#   geom_boxplot()
g2 <- survey_clean %>% 
  mutate(year = fct_relevel(`Class Year`, c('First Year', 'Sophomore', 'Junior', 'Senior'))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = `Walk Time`, x = year)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
grid.arrange(g1,g2,ncol=2)
```


<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
1. predict walk time to Mac based on photo rating and class year
2. regression ($y$ = time to mac is quantitative)
3. (answers will vary by semester -- what do you learn about the relationships between these variables?)
</details> 
<br><br>



6. **Machine learn about each other! Scenario C.**    
    Same directions as for Scenario A: (1) brainstorm what research question is being investigated; (2) determine whether this is a regression, classification, or clustering task; _and_ (3) summarize what the output tells you about your classmates. 
    
```{r exercise6-clustering}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 6

# prep data
survey_sub <- survey_clean %>% 
  select(-Section, -`Unique Word`, -`Preferred Name`)
fake_names <- survey_clean$`Unique Word`

# check for duplicates and add "2" if so
# might not need this (could comment out if so)
if(length(unique(fake_names)) != length(fake_names)){
  fake_names[duplicated(fake_names)] <- paste0(fake_names[duplicated(fake_names)], '2')
}

rownames(survey_sub) <- fake_names
    
    
# Dendrogram of scaled data
gower_dist <- daisy(survey_sub, metric = "gower", type = list(logratio = 3))
class_cluster <- hclust(gower_dist)
plot(class_cluster, cex = 0.8, main = "", axes = FALSE, xlab = "", ylab = "", sub = "")
```
    
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
1. which students in the class are most similar to which other students?
2. clustering (no outcome $y$, interested in structure/similarities across observations)
3. (answers will vary by semester -- to whom are you most similar? how many "natural" groupings of students do you see? etc.)
