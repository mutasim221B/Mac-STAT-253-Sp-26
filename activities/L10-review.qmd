# Preparing for Quiz 1 {-}

## Logistics {.unnumbered .smaller}


**When**: March 4 


**Topics**: 

  - ML Overview (Unit 0) + Regression (Units 1--3)
  - concepts **and** code


**Format**: 

  - On paper (no computers!)
  - Closed notes, except for an instructor-provided R notesheet
  - Questions will range in style: multiple choice, fill in the blank, short response, matching, etc.



***Questions?***


\

## Context {.unnumbered .smaller}

![](../images/MLdiagram.jpg){width=100%}

**What have we covered so far?**

For the Regression task: 

- Unit 0: What is Regression? (And how does it differ from other types of Machine Learning tasks?)
- Unit 1: Evaluating regression models
- Unit 2: Building regression models / selecting predictors
- Unit 3: Building flexible (nonparametric, nonlinear) regression models

General concepts that translate to other ML tasks:

- Overfitting
- Cross validation
- Bias-variance tradeoff
- Algorithms and tuning parameters
- Preprocessing steps
- Parametric vs nonparametric models

## Review & Reflection {.unnumbered .smaller}



STAT 253 is a survey course of statistical machine learning techniques and concepts. 
It's important to continuously reflect on these and how they fit together. 
The materials linked below are designed to help you reflect upon:

- ML concepts
    - enduring, big picture concepts
    - technical concepts
    - `tidymodels` code
- Your progress toward...        
    - engagement
    - collaboration
    - preparation (checkpoints)
    - exploration (homework)

Find and make a copy of the following 2 resources. You'll be given some relevant prompts below, but you should use these materials in *whatever way suits you*! Take notes, add more content, rearrange, etc. 

- [STAT 253 concept maps](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GIfPNfwnt7SwOTprYSLupunlrajCW7pJKQ9Q9rhHwZk/edit?usp=sharing)
- [tidymodels code comparison](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jyANFeAycznojZPEhUCl1O0VNljvuAQ4ZQQGuBm_WQo/edit?usp=sharing)

### Concept Maps {.unnumbered .smaller}

Mark up __slides 1--5__ of the concept map with respect to the prompts below.
Much of this overlaps with HW3.


**Enduring, big picture concepts**

IMPORTANT to your learning: Respond in your own words. 

- When do we perform a supervised vs unsupervised learning algorithm?
- Within supervised learning, when do we use a regression vs a classification algorithm?
- What is the importance of "model evaluation" and what questions does it address?
- What is "overfitting" and why is it bad?
- What is "cross-validation" and what problem is it trying to address?
- What is the "bias-variance tradeoff"?




**Technical concepts**

On slide 2, identify some general themes for each model algorithm listed in the lefthand table:

- What's the goal?
- Is the algorithm parametric or nonparametric?
- Does the algorithm have any tuning parameters? What are they, how do we tune them, and how is this a **goldilocks problem**?
- What are the key pros & cons of the algorithm?

For each algorithm, you should also reflect upon these **important technical concepts**:

- Can you summarize the steps of this algorithm?
- Is the algorithm parametric or nonparametric? (addressed above)
- What is the bias-variance tradeoff when working with or tuning this algorithm?
- Is it important to scale / pre-process our predictors before feeding them into this algorithm?
- Is this algorithm "computationally expensive"? What factors affect the computation time/cost? 
- Can you interpret the technical (RStudio) output for this algorithm? (eg: CV plots, etc)?





**Model evaluation**

On slide 2, do the following for each model evaluation question in the righthand table:

- Identify what to check or measure in order to address the question, and how to interpret it.
- Explain the steps of the CV algorithm.


**Algorithm comparisons**

- Use slide 3 to make other observations about the Unit 1-3 modeling algorithms and their connections.
- Use slide 4 to address and compare the interpretability & flexibility of the Subset Selection (e.g. backward stepwise), LASSO, and Least Squares algorithms. Where would you place Splines and KNN on this graphic?

### `tidymodels` Code Comparison {.unnumbered .smaller}

Check out and reflect upon the [tidymodels code comparisons here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jyANFeAycznojZPEhUCl1O0VNljvuAQ4ZQQGuBm_WQo/edit?usp=sharing). 
Copy, use, tweak, and add to this in whatever way suits you!

## Other Study Tips {.unnumbered .smaller}

- Create a study guide using the course [learning goals](https://mutasim221b.github.io/Mac-STAT-253-Sp-26/learning.html)
- Review past checkpoints, in-class exercises and notes (including R code), and homework problems
    - quiz yourself! (eg try the checkpoints/exercises again, without notes)
    - review homework feedback and implement any of the suggestions you received
- Complete the provided review activities: 
    - Concept maps
    - `tidymodels` code comparison
    - HW3
    - Group Assignment 1    
- Come to office hours (mine and preceptors)!




GA1 Submission reminders: 

- Each *group* will submit one (HTML) report
  - Use the Quarto **template** provided on Moodle
  - Carefully review the **instructions** (on Moodle) and [**rubric**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1menRHubJB3nxscsjI3Lvc5hWgEjJXCNs7WE5nRzWQ0Q/edit?usp=sharing) to ensure that you've included all requested information in the appropriate section  
- Each *individual* will submit the **Group Assignment Feedback Survey** (link on Moodle)
- Deadline for both components: end-of-day **Friday, Mar 6**
