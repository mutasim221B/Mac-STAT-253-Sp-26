    "text": "Section 03: M/W/F 02:20-03:20pm, THTR 213\nWelcome to STAT 253! This class is an introduction to the exciting world of statistical machine learning. Broadly, statistical machine learning consists of tools and algorithms to learn from data. Insights from machine learning help us take action by enabling us to make predictions and understand uncertainty. Applications of machine learning algorithms are used everywhere from finance to biology, medicine, social sciences, language, and the humanities.\nIn this course, you will build on the linear and logistic regression modeling techniques covered in STAT 155 to understand tools of regression (Weeks 2–6) and classification (Weeks 7–11) more broadly. You will also learn about unsupervised learning methods (Weeks 12–15) that can help you find underlying structure in data. Along the way, you’ll also improve your skills in computational thinking/programming, communication, collaboration, ethical thinking, and reflection, all of which are vital in any profession.",

You can call me Bill or Professor Billah & I use he/him pronouns. Back when I was an undergrad student, I didn’t have the best experience in Intro Stat—those courses often emphasized formulas over real understanding. That experience has shaped my teaching—I concentrate on illustrating how statistical theories connect and can be applied in the real world. I’m excited to teach STAT 253 and to create a more meaningful experience—one that helps all students feel confident applying it beyond the classroom. My methodological research lies at the intersection of statistical genetics, biostatistics, and genomics. My current research interests include developing novel statistical methods and computationally efficient bioinfor matics tools, leveraging modern machine- and deep-learning approaches analyze high-dimensional next-generation sequencing and multi-omics data to identify genes and regulatory mechanisms underlying complex diseases. Outside of my academic work, I enjoy spending time outdoors with family and friends or cooking variety of foods. If you can’t find me anywhere, I might be busy playing soccer or exploring new worlds on my PS5 Pro!\n\n\nOffice hours:\n\nLocation: My office (OLRI 234) and over Zoom\nTimes: M/W: 12:00pm - 12:30pm (in-person), T/TR: 2pm - 3pm (Over zoom, password: 123456)\nBy Appointment: I’m also happy to meet one-on-one if my normal drop-in/virtual hours don’t work for you. Shoot me an email and we can arrange it over zoom, password: 123456.\nEmail Response Time: I do my best to reply to emails promptly during weekdays. Please note that messages sent after 3:00 pm or on weekends may take longer to receive a response.",

Students are accountable for their own learning; as such, preceptors are not allowed to share answers to assignments (unless specifically directed by the instructor), are not expected to immediately know the right approach, or provide assistance outside of office hours. Additional guidelines and expectations on how to interact with preceptors can be found here.\nData and R Support: In addition to our course preceptors, there is support on campus for working with data and R / RStudio.

The purpose of this report is to ensure that anyone experiencing harm receives the resources and support they need. I will keep this information private, and it will not be shared beyond this required report.\nYou may also contact Macalester’s Title IX Coordinator directly (phone: 651-696-6258; e-mail: titleixcordinator@macalester.edu); they will provide you with supportive measures, resources, and referrals. Additional information about how to file a report (including anonymously) is available on the Title IX website.\nGeneral Health and Well-being: I care that you prioritize your well-being in this semester and beyond. Investing time into taking care of yourself will have profound impacts on all aspects of your life. Remember that beyond being a student, you are a human being carrying your own experiences, thoughts, emotions, and identities. It is important to acknowledge any stressors you may be facing, which can be mental, emotional, physical, cultural, financial, etc., and how they can have an impact on you. I encourage you to remember that you have a body with needs. In the classroom, eat when you are hungry, drink water, use the restroom, and step out if you are upset and need some air. Please do what is necessary so long as it does not impede your or others’ ability to be mentally and emotionally present in the course. Outside of the classroom, sleeping well, moving your body, and connecting with others can be strategies can help nourish you. If you are having difficulties maintaining your well-being, please don’t hesitate to contact me and/or find support from physical and mental health resources here, here, and here.",

Import this data using the read_csv() function, and store it as survey using the code below:\nFirst, in the Console pane of RStudio, run the following command to install some necessary packages (you will need to do this any time you are installing a new package):\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n# Load the \"tidyverse\" package which contains the read_csv() function\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Import the data\nsurvey &lt;- read_csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/112_fall_2024_survey.csv\")\n\n\n\nCheck out the data\nIn the Environment tab in the upper right pane of RStudio, click on survey. What happens?!\n\n\nIn the modern era, datasets often contain hundreds of variables and millions of observations. We need more effective ways to explore such data."

Then the population linear regression model is\n\\[\\begin{split}\ny & = f(x) + \\varepsilon  = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1} + \\beta_2 x_{2} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k} + \\varepsilon \\\\\n\\end{split}\\]\nNOTES:\n\n\\(\\beta\\) is the Greek letter “beta”. \\(\\varepsilon\\) is the Greek letter “epsilon”.\n\n“Linear” regression is so named because it assumes that \\(y\\) is a linear combination of the \\(x\\)’s. It does not mean that the relationship itself is linear!! For example, one of the predictors might be a quadratic term: \\(x_2 = x_1^2\\).\n\\(f(x) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1} + \\beta_2 x_{2} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k}\\) captures the trend of the relationship\n\n\\(\\beta_0\\) = intercept coefficient\nthe model value when \\(x_1=x_2=\\cdots=x_k=0\\)\n\\(\\beta_i\\) = \\(x_i\\) coefficient\nhow \\(x_i\\) is related to \\(y\\) when holding constant all other \\(x_i\\)\n\n\\(\\epsilon\\) reflects deviation from the trend (the residual)\n\n\n\n\nFitting the Model\nOnce we have a population model in mind, we can “fit the model” (i.e. estimate the \\(\\beta\\) population coefficients) using sample data:\n\\[\\begin{split}\ny & =  \\hat{f}(x) + \\varepsilon \\\\\n& = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_{1} + \\hat{\\beta}_2 x_{2} + \\cdots + \\hat{\\beta}_k x_{k} + \\varepsilon \\\\\n\\end{split}\\]\n\n\nTo this end, collect a sample of data on \\(n\\) subjects. Use subscripts to denote the data for subject \\(i\\): \\(y_i\\) and \\(x_{ij}\\). Then the predicted response and residual (prediction error) for subject \\(i\\) are\n\nprediction \\[\\hat{y}_i = \\hat{f}(x_i) = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_{i1} + \\hat{\\beta}_2 x_{i2} + \\cdots + \\hat{\\beta}_k x_{ik}\\]\nresidual / prediction error \\[y_i - \\hat{y}_i\\]\n\n\n\n\nLeast Squares Criterion\nEstimate (\\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1,..., \\beta_k\\)) by (\\(\\hat{\\beta}_0, \\hat{\\beta}_1,..., \\hat{\\beta}_k)\\) that minimize the sum of squared residuals: \\[\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 = (y_1-\\hat{y}_1)^2 + (y_2-\\hat{y}_2)^2 + \\cdots + (y_n-\\hat{y}_n)^2\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA comprehensive STAT 155 review is provided by the STAT 155 Notes created by Profs.
