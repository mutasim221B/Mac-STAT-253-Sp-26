    "text": "Section 03: M/W/F 02:20-03:20pm, THTR 213\nWelcome to STAT 253! This class is an introduction to the exciting world of statistical machine learning. Broadly, statistical machine learning consists of tools and algorithms to learn from data. Insights from machine learning help us take action by enabling us to make predictions and understand uncertainty. Applications of machine learning algorithms are used everywhere from finance to biology, medicine, social sciences, language, and the humanities.\nIn this course, you will build on the linear and logistic regression modeling techniques covered in STAT 155 to understand tools of regression (Weeks 2–6) and classification (Weeks 7–11) more broadly. You will also learn about unsupervised learning methods (Weeks 12–15) that can help you find underlying structure in data. Along the way, you’ll also improve your skills in computational thinking/programming, communication, collaboration, ethical thinking, and reflection, all of which are vital in any profession.",

You can call me Bill or Professor Billah & I use he/him pronouns. Back when I was an undergrad student, I didn’t have the best experience in Intro Stat—those courses often emphasized formulas over real understanding. That experience has shaped my teaching—I concentrate on illustrating how statistical theories connect and can be applied in the real world. I’m excited to teach STAT 253 and to create a more meaningful experience—one that helps all students feel confident applying it beyond the classroom. My methodological research lies at the intersection of statistical genetics, biostatistics, and genomics. My current research interests include developing novel statistical methods and computationally efficient bioinfor matics tools, leveraging modern machine- and deep-learning approaches analyze high-dimensional next-generation sequencing and multi-omics data to identify genes and regulatory mechanisms underlying complex diseases. Outside of my academic work, I enjoy spending time outdoors with family and friends or cooking variety of foods. If you can’t find me anywhere, I might be busy playing soccer or exploring new worlds on my PS5 Pro!\n\n\nOffice hours:\n\nLocation: My office (OLRI 234) and over Zoom\nTimes: M/W: 12:00pm - 12:30pm (in-person), T/TR: 2pm - 3pm (Over zoom, password: 123456)\nBy Appointment: I’m also happy to meet one-on-one if my normal drop-in/virtual hours don’t work for you. Shoot me an email and we can arrange it over zoom, password: 123456.\nEmail Response Time: I do my best to reply to emails promptly during weekdays. Please note that messages sent after 3:00 pm or on weekends may take longer to receive a response.",

Students are accountable for their own learning; as such, preceptors are not allowed to share answers to assignments (unless specifically directed by the instructor), are not expected to immediately know the right approach, or provide assistance outside of office hours. Additional guidelines and expectations on how to interact with preceptors can be found here.\nData and R Support: In addition to our course preceptors, there is support on campus for working with data and R / RStudio.

In other words, we estimate that this model can predict a new person’s height within, on average, 3.58 inches.\nLess. We only have to build 12 models.\nBoth neck and wrist are kicked out early! The 1-predictor model produced by this algorithm isn’t necessarily the best 1-predictor model (same for any number of predictors). Backward stepwise selection is a greedy algorithm!\nThe value of the coefficient (and thus the p-value) is dependent on the other variables in the model as we are accounting for or conditioning on them.\n\n\n\nBackward Stepwise Selection Final Model\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nBased on our data, I think the model with 1 predictor seems pretty reasonable! It’s simple and has the smallest CV MAE. If you’re worried that model is too simple, the model with 2 predictors also has a similarly small MAE.\nIf I were looking at the other MAE plot, though, I might pick a model with 1 (the simplest), 2 (still simple, but better MAE than 1 predictor), or 5 predictors (the model with the best CV MAE).\nToo few predictors: model is too simple. Too many predictors: model is too overfit.\n\n\n\nForward Stepwise Selection\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nStart with 0 predictors. Fit all possible models with 1 predictor. Add the predictor with the smallest p-value. To this model, add a second predictor with the smallest p-value. Continue until all predictors are in the model. (More details in ISLR Section 6.1.2.)\nMore. For 12 predictors, we’d have to build 12 models in step 1, 11 models in step 2, etc. Thus 12 + 11 + … + 1 = 78 models total.\n\n\n\nMachine Learning vs Human Learning\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n1\n2",

(It will be!)\n\n\nLet’s take a look at some code that we’ll use to build future models.

Of primary interest to the company is:\nHow many registered riders can we expect today?\nTo this end, you will build, evaluate, and compare 2 different linear regression models of ridership using the following Capital Bikeshare dataset (originally from the UCI Machine Learning Repository):\n\nModel 1: rides ~ windspeed + temp\nModel 2: rides ~ windspeed + temp + weekend\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore the data\n\nTake a minute to get familiar with the data.\n\n# Load packages we'll need to wrangle and plot the data\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Load the data\nbikes &lt;- read.csv(\"https://Mac-Stat.github.io/data/bike_share.csv\")\n\n# Only keep / select some variables\n# And round some variables (just for our demo purposes)\nbikes &lt;- bikes %&gt;% \n  rename(rides = riders_registered, temp = temp_feel) %&gt;% \n  mutate(windspeed = round(windspeed), temp = round(temp)) %&gt;% \n  select(rides, windspeed, temp, weekend)\n\n\n# Check out the dimensions\ndim(bikes)\n## [1] 731   4\n\n# Check out the first 3 rows\nhead(bikes, 3)\n##   rides windspeed temp weekend\n## 1   654        11   65    TRUE\n## 2   670        17   64    TRUE\n## 3  1229        17   49   FALSE\n\nThis dataset contains the following information for a sample of different dates:\n\n\n\nvariable\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nrides\ncount of daily rides by registered users\n\n\nwindspeed\nwind speed in miles per hour\n\n\ntemp\nwhat the temperature feels like in degrees Fahrenheit\n\n\nweekend\nwhether or not it falls on a weekend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot the relationships\n\nFirst, let’s plot these relationships.\nREMEMBER: Don’t write in any chunk with starter code.

This code is more complicated than the lm() function we used in STAT 155. BUT:\n\ntidymodels is part of the broader tidyverse (what we use to plot and wrangle data), thus the syntax is more consistent\ntidymodels generalizes to the other ML algorithms we’ll survey in this course, thus will eventually minimize the unique syntax we need to learn\n\n\n# Load package\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n\nThe first step is to specify what type of model we want to build. We’ll store this as lm_spec, our linear regression model (lm) specification (spec).\n\nlm_spec &lt;- linear_reg() %&gt;%   # we want a linear regression model\n  set_mode(\"regression\") %&gt;%  # this is a regression task (y is quantitative)\n  set_engine(\"lm\")            # we'll estimate the model using the lm function\n\nThis code specifies but doesn’t build any model – we didn’t even give it any data or specify the variables of interest!\n\n# Check it out\nlm_spec\n## Linear Regression Model Specification (regression)\n## \n## Computational engine: lm\n\n\n\n\n\ntidymodels STEP 2\n\nWe can now estimate or fit our two ridership models using the specified model structure (lm_spec) and our sample bikes data:\n\n# Fit bike_model_1\nbike_model_1 &lt;- lm_spec %&gt;% \n  fit(rides ~ windspeed + temp, data = bikes)\n\n# Check out the coefficients\nbike_model_1 %&gt;% \n  tidy()\n## # A tibble: 3 × 5\n##   term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n##   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n## 1 (Intercept)    -20.8    300.     -0.0694 9.45e- 1\n## 2 windspeed      -36.1      9.42   -3.83   1.37e- 4\n## 3 temp            55.4      3.33   16.6    7.58e-53\n\n\n# YOUR TURN\n# Fit bike_model_2 & check out the coefficients\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it fair?\n\nNow, let’s evaluate our two models. First, do you have any concerns about the context in which the data were collected and analyzed? About the potential impact of this analysis?\n\n\n\n\nIs it strong?\n\nWe can measure and compare the strength of these models using \\(R^2\\), the proportion of variability in our response variable that’s explained by the model. Report which model is stronger and interpret its \\(R^2\\).\n\n# Obtain R^2 for bike_model_1\nbike_model_1 %&gt;% \n  glance()\n## # A tibble: 1 × 12\n##   r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic  p.value    df logLik    AIC    BIC\n##       &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n## 1     0.310         0.308 1298.      163. 2.44e-59     2 -6276. 12560. 12578.\n## # ℹ 3 more variables: deviance &lt;dbl&gt;, df.residual &lt;int&gt;, nobs &lt;int&gt;\n\n\n# YOUR TURN\n# Obtain R^2 for bike_model_2\n\n\n\n\n\nPause – predictions and residuals\n\nOur next model evaluation questions will focus on the models’ predictions and prediction errors, or residuals. We can obtain this information by augmenting our models with our original bikes data. For example:\n\n# Calculate predicted ridership (.pred) & corresponding residuals (.resid) using bike_model_1\n# Just look at first 6 days\nbike_model_1 %&gt;% \n  augment(new_data = bikes) %&gt;% \n  head()\n## # A tibble: 6 × 6\n##   .pred .resid rides windspeed  temp weekend\n##   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;  \n## 1 3183. -2529.   654        11    65 TRUE   \n## 2 2911. -2241.   670        17    64 TRUE   \n## 3 2080.  -851.  1229        17    49 FALSE  \n## 4 2407.  -953.  1454        11    51 FALSE  \n## 5 2446.  -928.  1518        13    53 FALSE  \n## 6 2699. -1181.  1518         6    53 FALSE\n\nWe can also predict outcomes for new observations using either augment() or predict(). Note the difference in the output:\n\n# Predict ridership on a 60 degree day with 20 mph winds\nbike_model_1 %&gt;% \n  augment(new_data = data.frame(windspeed = 20, temp = 60))\n## # A tibble: 1 × 3\n##   .pred windspeed  temp\n##   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n## 1 2581.        20    60\n\n\n# Predict ridership on a 60 degree day with 20 mph winds\nbike_model_1 %&gt;% \n  predict(new_data = data.frame(windspeed = 20, temp = 60))\n## # A tibble: 1 × 1\n##   .pred\n##   &lt;dbl&gt;\n## 1 2581.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes it produce accurate predictions?\n\nRecall that the mean absolute error (MAE) measures the typical prediction error. Specifically, it is the mean of the absolute values of the residual errors for the days in our dataset.\n\nUse the residuals to calculate the MAE for the 2 models. HINT: abs()\n\n\n# DON'T TYPE IN THIS CHUNK\n# MAE for bike_model_1\nbike_model_1 %&gt;% \n  augment(new_data = bikes) %&gt;% \n  summarize(mae = ___(___(___)))\n\n\n# MAE for bike_model_1\nbike_model_1 %&gt;% \n  augment(new_data = bikes) %&gt;% \n  summarize(mae = mean(abs(.resid)))\n## # A tibble: 1 × 1\n##     mae\n##   &lt;dbl&gt;\n## 1 1080.\n\n\n# YOUR TURN: MAE for bike_model_2\n\n\nDoing the calculation from scratch helps solidify your understanding of how MAE is calculated, thus interpreted. Check your calculations using a shortcut function.\n\n\n# Calculate MAE for the first model\nbike_model_1 %&gt;% \n  augment(new_data = bikes) %&gt;% \n  mae(truth = rides, estimate = .pred)\n## # A tibble: 1 × 3\n##   .metric .estimator .estimate\n##   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n## 1 mae     standard       1080.\n\n\n# YOUR TURN\n# Calculate MAE for the second model\n\n\nWhich model has more accurate predictions?\nInterpret the MAE for this model, in context, and comment on whether it’s “large” or “small”. NOTE: “large” or “small” is defined by the context (e.g. relative to the observed range of ridership, the consequences of a bad prediction, etc).\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it wrong?\n\nTo determine whether the linear regression assumptions behind bike_model_1 and bike_model_2 are reasonable, we can review residual plots, i.e. plots of the residuals vs predictions for each observation in our dataset. Run the code below and summarize your assessment of whether our models are wrong. RECALL: We want the points to appear random and centered around 0 across the entire range of the model / predictions.\n\n# Residual plot for bike_model_1\nbike_model_1 %&gt;% \n  augment(new_data = bikes) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = .pred, y = .resid)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0) + \n    geom_smooth() # add trend line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# YOUR TURN\n# Residual plot for bike_model_2\n\n\n\n\n\nArt vs science\n\nInspecting residual plots is more art than science.1 It requires a lot of practice. Consider another example using simulated data. First, build a model that assumes all predictors are roughly linearly related:\n\n# Import data\nsimulated_data &lt;- read.csv(\"https://Mac-Stat.github.io/data/simulated_data.csv\")\n\n# Model y by the 6 input variables\nnew_model &lt;- lm_spec %&gt;% \n  fit(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6, simulated_data)\n\nNext, check out a pairs plot. Is there anything here that makes you think that our model assumption is bad? (NOTE: if you are not familiar with the ggpairs function we are using below, chat with your group and look for resources to figure out what this is doing!)\n\nnew_model %&gt;% \n  augment(new_data = simulated_data) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = .pred, y = .resid)) + \n  geom_point(size = 0.1) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails – communication & code style\n\nCommunication is a key machine learning skill, including written summaries, presentations, and code. Just like an essay, code must have structure, signposts, and grammar that will make it easier for others to follow. The below code runs, but it is “bad code”.\n\nFix this code and add comments so that it is easier for yourself and others to follow.\nAlso pay attention to what this code does.\n\n\nbikes %&gt;%\n  group_by(weekend) %&gt;%\n  summarize(median(rides))\n## # A tibble: 2 × 2\n##   weekend `median(rides)`\n##   &lt;lgl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n## 1 FALSE              3848\n## 2 TRUE               2955\n\n\nmynewdatasetissmallerthantheoriginal&lt;-bikes%&gt;%filter(rides&lt;=700,weekend==FALSE,temp&gt;60)\nmynewdatasetissmallerthantheoriginal\n##   rides windspeed temp weekend\n## 1   577        18   67   FALSE\n## 2   655        18   68   FALSE\n## 3    20        24   72   FALSE\n\n\nmynewdatasetusescelsius&lt;-bikes%&gt;%mutate(temp=(temp-32)*5/9)\nhead(mynewdatasetusescelsius)\n##   rides windspeed      temp weekend\n## 1   654        11 18.333333    TRUE\n## 2   670        17 17.777778    TRUE\n## 3  1229        17  9.444444   FALSE\n## 4  1454        11 10.555556   FALSE\n## 5  1518        13 11.666667   FALSE\n## 6  1518         6 11.666667   FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\nSTAT 155 Review – model interpretation & application\n\nLet’s interpret and apply bike_model_2.\n\n___ %&gt;% \n  tidy()\n\n\nHow can we interpret the temp coefficient?\n\n\nWe expect roughly 54 more riders on warm days.\nWe expect roughly 54 more riders per every 1 degree increase in temperature.\nWhen controlling for windspeed and weekend status, we expect roughly 54 more riders on warm days.\nWhen controlling for windspeed and weekend status, we expect roughly 54 more riders per every 1 degree increase in temperature.\n\n\nHow can we interpret the weekendTRUE coefficient?\n\n\nWe expect roughly 858 fewer riders on weekends.\nWe expect roughly 858 fewer riders per every extra weekend.\nWhen controlling for windspeed and temperature, we expect roughly 858 fewer riders on weekends.\nWhen controlling for windspeed and temperature, we expect roughly 858 fewer riders per every extra weekend.\n\n\nReproduce the predicted ridership and corresponding residual for day 1 from scratch (how were these calculated?!):\n\n\nbike_model_2 %&gt;% \n  ___(new_data = bikes) %&gt;% \n  head(1)\n\n\n\n\n\nSTAT 155 Review – data wrangling\n\nThrough the “Details: communication & code style” and elsewhere, you’ve reviewed the use of various dplyr data wrangling verbs: filter(), mutate(), summarize(), group_by(), select(), arrange().

For more on this topic, you might check out Coded Bias, a documentary by Shalini Kantayya which features MIT Media Lab researcher Joy Buolamwini.\nPolygenic risk scores (PRSs), which aim to predict a person’s risk of developing a particular disease/trait based on their genetics, are often overfit to the data on which they are built (which, historically, has exclusively—or at least primarily—included individuals of European ancestry). As a result, PRS predictions tend to be more accurate in European populations and new research suggests that their continued use in clinical settings could exacerbate health disparities.\nThere are connections to overfitting in the article for the ethics reflection on HW1 (about a former Amazon recruiting algorithm.",

Thus LOOCV is equivalent to \\(k = n\\) fold CV.\nIn pictures: In the end, we fit \\(n\\) training models (blue lines) and test each on one test car (red dots).\n\n## Error in sample_n(., size = 20, replace = FALSE): could not find function \"sample_n\"\n## Error: object 'cars_rep' not found\n## Error in mutate(., replicate = as.factor(replicate)): could not find function \"mutate\"\n## Error: object 'cars_rep' not found\n## Error: object 'cars_rep' not found\n\n\n## Error in ggplot(train_sets, aes(x = horsepower, y = mpg)): could not find function \"ggplot\"\n\n\nHow is 2-fold cross-validation (CV) different from validation? (Validation is what we did last class: splitting our sample into a training dataset and a testing dataset.)\n\n\nWe use both groups as training and testing, in turn.\n\n\nWhy might 3-fold CV be better than 2-fold CV?\n\n\nWe have a larger dataset to train our model on. We are less likely to get an unrepresentative set as our training data. We are also averaging our overall cross-validated MAE estimate over more testing folds, which is likely to result in a more stable estimate of out-of-sample error.\n\n\nWhy might LOOCV (leave-one-out CV) (k-fold CV where k = sample size) be worse than 3-fold cross-validation?\n\n\nPrediction error for 1 person is highly variable. Also, for computational time reasons, fitting models can be very slow.\n\n\nIn practice, \\(k = 10\\) and \\(k=7\\) are common choices for cross-validation. This has been shown to hit the ‘sweet spot’ between the extremes of \\(k=n\\) (LOOCV) and \\(k=2\\).\n\n\n\\(k=2\\) only utilizes 50% of the data for each training model, thus might result in overestimating the prediction error\n\\(k=n\\) leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) requires us to build \\(n\\) training models, thus might be computationally expensive for larger sample sizes \\(n\\). Further, with only one data point in each test set, the training sets have a lot of overlap. This correlation among the training sets can make the ultimate corresponding estimate of prediction error less reliable.\n\n\n\nR Code Preview\n\nWe’ve been doing a 2-step process to build linear regression models using the tidymodels package:\n\n# STEP 1: model specification\nlm_spec &lt;- linear_reg() %&gt;%\n  set_mode(\"regression\") %&gt;% \n  set_engine(\"lm\")\n  \n# STEP 2: model estimation\nmy_model &lt;- lm_spec %&gt;% \n  fit(\n    y ~ x1 + x2,\n    data = sample_data\n  )\n\nFor k-fold cross-validation, we can tweak STEP 2. Discuss the code below:\n\nWhat’s similar? What’s different? &gt; Similar to fit(), we tell the function fit_resamples what model to fit and which data to use. But, instead of fitting that model once to the full data, we use CV.\nWhat do you think each new, or otherwise modified, line does?\nWhy do we need set.seed?\n\n\nset.seed(___) # set seed for reproducibility\n\nmy_model_cv &lt;- lm_spec %&gt;% # take the model specs we defined earlier, and then\n  \n  fit_resamples( # fit multiple models (across multiple resamples of the data)\n    \n    y ~ x1 + x2, # the model we want to fit\n    \n    resamples = vfold_cv(sample_data, v = ___), # use \"v\"-fold CV to create the resamples (fill in the blank to specify \"v\", aka \"k\")\n    \n    metrics = metric_set(mae, rsq) # specify which evaluation metric(s) (MAE, R^2) to use \n    \n  )\n\nHere are a few general tips for breaking down complex code:\n\nRead the R Documentation / help page for any new functions (eg type ?fit_resamples into the Console)\nTry removing or otherwise modifying each line of code and see what happens!\n\nWhy set a seed? The process of creating the folds is random, so we should set the seed to have reproducibility within our work.",
