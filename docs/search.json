Our goals are to get to know the people in this class and to start working with data.\nBy the end of this lesson, you should be able to:\n\nDefine cases and variables\nApply the 5 W’s + H (who, what, when, where, why, and how) to data collection\n\nLinks to related reading(s):\n\nWhat is Data?\nData Context\n\nThis activity is structured a bit differently than the activities for the remainder of the class. In this section, you’ll typically find a mini-lecture, review material, or guided / structural examples, followed by exercises.\nFor today, you’ll have some steps to follow for an interactive, tactile activity at your tables before working through the exercises below together.\n\n\nAt your table, write a one to two word answer to each of the following 7 question(s), each on a separate post-it note (do this individually). If there are two questions: write your answer to the first question on the left-hand side of the post-it note, and your answer to the second question on the bottom of the post-it note.\n\nHow many hours of sleep did you get last night? How many cups of coffee did you drink this morning?\nWhat is your declared or potential major? (If you are a double major, just pick whichever one you think of first.)\nWhat is your class year? (first year, sophomore, junior, senior)\nHow many stats courses have you taken in the past?\nOn a scale of 1 (get me out of here) to 10 (yay!), how excited are you about this course?\nIs it your birthday this semester? (yes/no)\nHow many unread emails do you have in your inbox right now?\nHave you used R/RStudio a lot, a little, or never?\n\n\n\n\nDesignate one person from your table to distribute your group’s answers to the questions to the corresponding “station” around the classroom. Each table should have a number on it, corresponding to the “station”/question.\n\n\n\nFill out an electronic version of these questions. We’ll come back to this in a future class. Wait until everyone in your group is done with this before moving on to the exercises."

Broadly, statistical machine learning consists of tools and algorithms to learn from data. Insights from machine learning help us take action by enabling us to make predictions and understand uncertainty. Applications of machine learning algorithms are used everywhere from finance to biology, medicine, social sciences, language, and the humanities.\nIn this course, you will build on the linear and logistic regression modeling techniques covered in STAT 155 to understand tools of regression (Weeks 2–6) and classification (Weeks 7–11) more broadly. You will also learn about unsupervised learning methods (Weeks 12–15) that can help you find underlying structure in data. Along the way, you’ll also improve your skills in computational thinking/programming, communication, collaboration, ethical thinking, and reflection, all of which are vital in any profession.",

You can call me Mutasim, Bill or Professor Billah & I use he/him pronouns. Back when I was an undergrad student, I didn’t have the best experience in Intro Stat—those courses often emphasized formulas over real understanding. That experience has shaped my teaching—I concentrate on illustrating how statistical theories connect and can be applied in the real world. I’m excited to teach STAT 155 and to create a more meaningful experience—one that helps all students feel confident applying it beyond the classroom. My methodological research lies at the intersection of statistical genetics, biostatistics, and genomics. My current research interests include developing novel statistical methods and computationally efficient bioinformatics tools, leveraging modern machine- and deep-learning approaches analyze high-dimensional next-generation sequencing and multi-omics data to identify genes and regulatory mechanisms underlying complex diseases. Outside of my academic work, I enjoy spending time outdoors with family and friends or cooking variety of foods. If you can’t find me anywhere, I might be busy playing soccer or exploring new worlds on my PS5 Pro!\n\n\nDrop-in (office) hours:\n\nLocation: My office (OLRI 234)\nTimes: M/W/F: 11:10am - 11:40 am, W: 1:20pm - 2:50pm\nBy Appointment: I’m also happy to meet one-on-one if my normal drop-in hours don’t work for you.

Relatedly, though AI can be helpful with parts of a statistical analysis (eg: getting unstuck on code, checking grammar), you have to guide that process (eg: what questions are we trying to answer? what’s a reasonable approach?).\nWork on an exercise for at least 30 minutes before even thinking about AI. You will learn very little if you overly rely on AI, hence be unprepared for other interactions with the material (eg: in-class discussions, quizzes, future courses that build upon 155, etc). Learning comes from you doing the puzzling, not from you producing a correct answer.\nWhether or not you use AI, you must be able to defend/explain any code/discussion you hand in. You cannot simply use AI to bypass your own learning.\nYou may not use AI to generate entire arguments or discussions.

    "text": "(5) Project (Independence & Application)\nMore details will be provided later in the semester. Here are some basics:\n\nWe’ll start working on projects in ~week 6, with the majority of the work happening later in the semester.\nThe projects are collaborative. You will be working in groups. Though you will work in assigned groups at various points throughout the semester, you will pick your own group for the project. This is something to think about as you meet other students in class and learn about common interests.\nProject grades will be based upon a final group written report (no oral presentation), multiple group and individual checkpoints, and individual contributions to the project (thus it’s possible for different group members to earn different grades).",

    "text": "(6) Quizzes (Content Expertise)\nYour course engagement, collaboration, preparation, practice, and application will support your deeper understanding of the course material. This will be assessed through three in-person quizzes. You must schedule all travel and other commitments around them — there will not be any alternative quiz times.\n\nQuiz 1: Wednesday, 09/24 in class (tentative)\nQuiz 2: Wednesday, 10/29 in class (tentative)\nQuiz 3: Finals week\n\nThe exam will be written to take ~1.25 hours, but you will have the full 2-hour period to complete it.\n\n09:40–10:40 am section 03: Monday 12/15- 08:00am-10:00am\n12:00–01:00 pm section 04: Saturday 12.13- 08:00am-10:00am\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📜 Quiz Policies\n\n\n\n\nAll quizzes will have the following format:\n\nTaken individually, using pen/pencil & paper\n\nYou will not need to write code or use a calculator, but you will need to read & interpret R output\n\nClosed notes, but you may use a 3x5 index card with writing on both sides. These can be handwritten or typed, but you may not include screenshots or share note cards. Making your own card is important to the review process- as you are required to submit the index card along with the answer paper.\n\nQuizzes 2 & 3 will be cumulative. This is unavoidable as the material builds upon itself.\nQuiz corrections:\nYou can earn up to 50% of missed points back on Quizzes 1 & 2 if you:\n\nWrite a reflection of how you prepared for the quiz and where you felt strongest or more uncertain in your understanding before taking the quiz; and\n\nSubmit your quiz corrections along with your reflection to the instructor, no later than one week after quizzes have been handed back.\nNote: Quiz 3 corrections are not allowed due to time constraints at the end of the semester.",

    "text": "Late work on Practice Problems (PPs)\nThroughout the semester, you may use up to three, three-day extensions. These three extensions can be used on Practice Problems only, not quizzes. The purpose of deadlines (and extensions) are to keep you accountable for your own learning, to keep you on track with the pace of the course (which builds upon itself throughout the semester), and to provide preceptors and myself with the ability to provide you with timely feedback on assignments. Since the Problem Sets are due roughly every two weeks, you must begin working on them early if you want to succeed.\nExtensions can be used automatically, without letting me know in advance. The Moodle dropboxes for assignments will close exactly 3 days after the original deadline (i.e. Mondays at 11:59pm), and I will not accept work submitted after that point unless there are extenuating circumstances that you have communicated with me about ahead of the original deadline. If you email me a completed assignment after a 3-day extension is up, I may have the preceptors provide you with feedback, but you will not receive credit for the assignment (equivalent to “Needs Improvement” on every question of the relevant assignment).\nI expect you to keep track of how many extensions you’ve used. I will do my best to email you a reminder if you have used all three of your extensions and have none remaining.\nIf you have run out of extensions and/or an extenuating circumstance occurs that impacts your ability to submit assignments on time, please email me to discuss the situation. I am happy to be flexible as long as you communicate!",

    "text": "Well-being\nI want you to succeed. Both here at Macalester and beyond. To help make this happen, I am committed to the following.\nRespect: Everyone comes from a different path through life, and it is our moral duty as human beings to listen to each other without judgment and to respect one another. I have no tolerance for discrimination of any kind, in and out of the classroom. If you are seeking campus resources regarding discrimination, the Department of Multicultural Life and the Center for Religious and Spiritual Life are wonderful resources. We will also respect the MSCS Community Guidelines.\nSensitive Topics: Applications in this course span issues in science, policy, and society. As such, we may sometimes address sensitive topics. I will try to announce in class if an assignment or activity involves a potentially sensitive topic. If you have reservations about a particular topic, please come talk to me to discuss possible options.\nAccommodations: If you need accommodations for any reason, please contact Disability Services to discuss your needs, and speak with me as soon as possible afterwards so that we can discuss your accommodation plan. If you already have official accommodations, please discuss these with me within the first week of class so that you get off to a great start. Contact me if you have other special circumstances. I will find resources for you.\nTitle IX: You deserve a community free from discrimination, sexual harassment, hostility, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. If you or anyone you know has experienced harassment or discrimination, know that you are not alone. Macalester provides staff and resources to help you find support. Please be aware that as a faculty member, it is my responsibility to report disclosure about sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, relationship violence, and stalking to the Title IX Office. The purpose of this report is to ensure that anyone experiencing harm receives the resources and support they need. I will keep this information private, and it will not be shared beyond this required report.\nYou may also contact Macalester’s Title IX Coordinator directly (phone: 651-696-6258; e-mail: titleixcordinator@macalester.edu); they will provide you with supportive measures, resources, and referrals. Additional information about how to file a report (including anonymously) is available on the Title IX website.\nGeneral Health and Well-being: I care that you prioritize your well-being in this semester and beyond. Investing time into taking care of yourself will have profound impacts on all aspects of your life. Remember that beyond being a student, you are a human being carrying your own experiences, thoughts, emotions, and identities. It is important to acknowledge any stressors you may be facing, which can be mental, emotional, physical, cultural, financial, etc., and how they can have an impact on you. I encourage you to remember that you have a body with needs. In the classroom, eat when you are hungry, drink water, use the restroom, and step out if you are upset and need some air. Please do what is necessary so long as it does not impede your or others’ ability to be mentally and emotionally present in the course. Outside of the classroom, sleeping well, moving your body, and connecting with others can be strategies can help nourish you. If you are having difficulties maintaining your well-being, please don’t hesitate to contact me and/or find support from physical and mental health resources here, here, and here.",
